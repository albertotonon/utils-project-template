# This is a template for the credential informations you're going to need during your
# experiments. This file is going to Git, so, define only the variables and not the values, 
# as in the examples below. This is useful in case somebody else is contributing to your project.
# You should then create a `credentials.sh` file (entry already contained in .gitignore) with
# the actual values of the credentials. That file will be automatically loaded in your environment by 
# direnv.

# export ML_DB_SERVER=''
# export ML_DB_DBNAME=''
# export ML_USERNAME=''
# export ML_PASSWORD=''
